> Welcome to Snowslinger's Spellbinding Sherbets and Sorbets! Every flavor is sure to leave you ***enchanted!***

Your party is greeted by Mr. Snowslinger himself as you enter the curious dessert parlor. Tendrils of mist descend from a long wooden ice box before you. It's filled with ten different buckets of delicious-looking treats. For 1GP, you may purchase a cup in a flavor of your choosing, or you may ask Mr. Snowslinger to give you one at random.

When each person finishes their cup, they feel the spoon in their hand pulse with a strange power. With a successful Arcana check (DC 10), you discover that each spoon is now an arcane focus for a single-charge instance of a spell. The particular spell endowed in the spoon corresponds to the flavor of ice cream chosen.

The spoon's power only works if you finish the entire treat. That means the pickle flavor especially!
